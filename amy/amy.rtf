\f0\b \cf0 Chris.
\f1\b0  Hello Amy. I have appointments this morning but could talk today at 2pm Pacific, or later. I can also talk tomorrow morning. I see that XXXXXX is an investment management firm. Are you acting on behalf of a company your firm has invested in?\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Good afternoon, it's great to receive your reply. I'm in NYC, and we can communicate via text after 6 PM Eastern Time. Yes, I'm the CPO of XXXXXX, and I'm from Singapore. My Chinese name is XXXX XXXXXX, you can call me Amy\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  Very good, Amy. We can talk more then, during your evening.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Okay, I'll see you tonight, I wish you a productive day\
\

\f0\b Amy [voice message, human quality, young Asian female]
\f1\b0 . 
\f2\i Also I would like to mention that since we are a startup, I need to keep written records of our communication. Many ideas and details will require ongoing discussion and clarification. So for now we\'92ll communicate here in text to be sure everything is clear and accurate. Once we have confirmed the key details I will arrange a video meeting within a week. Does this sound OK to you?
\f1\i0 \
\

\f0\b Chris [voice message, human, mature Anglo male].
\f1\b0  
\f2\i Hello Amy. I understand that you are a startup, and so you must be cautious about ideas and so on. I am not entirely sure of the nature of what you would like to discuss, and I hope that will become clear this evening. I look forward to further conversation with you.
\f1\i0 \
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Of course, thank you for your understanding. To better understand your expertise and potential job opportunities, could you briefly introduce yourself and your professional background?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  All of this is available on my Linkedin profile which your assistant would have reviewed before putting us in touch with each other, but l will write a brief summary below\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Yes, my assistant did share some background information about you. It would be even better if you could briefly introduce yourself in your own words. I have a few documents to finish up right now, but you can send everything here, I\'92ll get back to you later today\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  Certainly. We are both interested in establishing the legitimacy of this discussion. Generally, when a founder reaches out to me, they know what they want and why l might be able to provide it.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  I am an electrical engineer by training. I developed telecommunications equipment and standards at Motorola for 20 years, culminating as a director of corporate strategy. After that I had a variety of engineering and senior leadership roles at start-ups, and some established companies, in the video game industry. Then I led development of mobile productivity apps for Amazon, and development of the CI/CD system, integration of machine learning into quality assurance, and engineering performance analytics for all of indeed.com. Most recently l have led interactive and immersive software engineering efforts at MSG Sphere and at Cosm. I have run layered mixed-discipline organizations of up to 50 people, and dotted-line lobbying organizations of up to 100. I\'92ll do my best to answer questions you might pose.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Chris, thank you for sharing such a remarkable career trajectory, your cross-domain experience from telecommunications to immersive technology is genuinely impressive. The combination of deep engineering discipline and strategic leadership you've demonstrated across Motorola, Amazon, Indeed, and Cosm aligns perfectly with what we are building.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  I\'92m currently serving as Chief People Officer at XXXXXX, a global investment and technology platform headquartered in New York with offices in Silicon Valley, London, Hong Kong, and Singapore. We manage multi-billion-dollar funds across venture capital, growth equity, and public markets, with a strong focus on artificial intelligence, cloud infrastructure, fintech, immersive media, and sustainable innovation.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Our next initiative is to establish a Seattle-based technology subsidiary dedicated to immersive software, Al-driven interactive systems, and real-time content engineering. Given your unique blend of technical and strategic expertise, | believe your perspective could play a vital role in shaping this project\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  That does read as appealing from a technology perspective, but what is the market? Who is the customer? Or are you building a think-tank? This is a very broad field. It spans handhelds to home theaters to entertainment complexes to military and training to state-sponsored showpieces.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  You're absolutely right, Chris, the field is broad, but our focus is on commercial immersive systems that bridge entertainment, education, and experiential branding. Our core clients are global developers and operators of large scale venues, theme parks, and Al integrated digital showcases\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  That seems very much like what Cosm already does.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  I\'92d love to understand your current situation a bit better, are you between roles or currently employed? And could you share what position you're in now and the size of the team you've been leading?\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0 \
> That seems very much like what Cosm already does.\
That's a great observation, Cosm focuses on delivering immersive experiences, while our initiative approaches it from the infrastructure and intelligence layer. We're not building another venue; we're building the Al driven engine that powers the next generation of interactive environments across industries\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  XXX\'85XXX. I am between roles. I literally answered the question about team size in what l posted for you above.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  Cosm does not focus on delivering experiences. They [own] Evans & Sutherland and other companies that build this infrastructure for the education, entertainment, and sports markets among others. The Cosm venues are the showpieces. Almost all of the infrastructure is also made by Cosm. XXX\'85XXX\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Thank you for clarifying that, Chris, I really appreciate the context and your transparency.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  At XXXXXX, we're establishing a Seattle-based subsidiary that will serve as the Al Systems & Immersive Infrastructure Lab within our global innovation network. The core mission isn't to compete with Cosm or create venues, but rather to develop the Al-driven middleware and orchestration layer that connects immersive content, real-time rendering, and large-scale physical environments, from digital twins and education tech to live entertainment and experiential retail.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  This subsidiary will integrate closely with our teams in New York, Los Angeles, and Singapore, focusing on scalable architecture, simulation frameworks, and adaptive Al systems that can serve multiple industries. Your leadership background, bridging strategy, engineering, and cross-discipline execution, would be incredibly relevant as we define both the architecture and the roadmap for this initiative.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  If this direction resonates with you, Id love to continue the conversation and share how we're structuring the lab and the potential role wed envision for you.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  This is of interest to me, l'd love to hear more. The description seems like a bunch of buzzwords at this point; it's hard to tell whether "there's a there there" or this is plant a thousand Al related seeds and see what grows.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  l am very pleased that we have reached a preliminary consensus. Our operations center in Seattle is currently assembling the founding team, and we particularly hope that talents like you, with strategic vision and leadership skills, will join us\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  There are many interesting and difficult problems in this space. Some rough guardrails and signposts will help make this team successful, whether with or without me! Part of this is that your Al play has to be something more than letters people use to get investment. Generative Al is only a sliver of Al. You must have clarity on what role Al plays.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  l appreciate your candor. What we're building isn't another "Al buzzword venture." It's an applied industrial initiative with defined capital, technology partners, and a clear commercialization path.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  In XXXXX, we're structuring a XXXXXX subsidiary focused on Al-integrated process optimization, sustainable chemical production, and advanced materials automation. Think of it as the bridge between next-generation industrial intelligence and traditional high-efficiency plant operations, integrating predictive analytics, digital twins, and autonomous maintenance systems into chemical and pipeline environments.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  The objective is simple: to improve uptime, energy efficiency, and safety through intelligent automation, while reducing OPEX and emissions. We've already begun assembling a core technical and operational advisory group, and we're looking for experienced leaders who understand both the engineering reality and the transformation potential\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  That's a reasonable use-case, in my opinion. It sounds quite different from what you are planning for Seattle.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  You're absolutely right, I completely agree. "Al" has become a word that too many people use without ever defining what it truly means or does.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  In our model, its role is very specific and measurable. Within XXXXXX, Al isn't the product itself, it's the optimization engine behind it. We use it to anticipate equipment failures, optimize chemical and pipeline processes, and create live digital twins that simulate plant behavior under varying conditions.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  So when we talk about Al, it's not marketing. It's data, control logic, and continuous learning applied at industrial scale. Our goal is to merge the proven discipline of plant operations with the intelligence layer that makes production safer, more efficient, and more sustainable\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  For immersion, digital twins, interaction, market-of-one advertising, there is another set of problems to be solved. These are very much about humans, while it could be argued that plant safety and automation are about removing humans from where they need not be. If you extend to a world in which everyone has an Al agent that negotiates on their behalf, the cases move closer together. Today though, I see them as distinct.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  You've articulated that distinction beautifully, and I completely agree. Today, human-centered Al and automation-driven Al do operate as separate domains, each with its own logic and purpose. One is about augmenting people, the other about protecting or replacing them in high-risk or repetitive environments.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  But I also share your view of where this could evolve. In a world where every individual or organization has an intelligent agent capable of representing their interests, the boundaries between those two cases start to blur. At that point, the conversation shifts from "humans vs. machines" to "humans through machines."\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  That's exactly the horizon XXXXXX is planning for, systems that begin with industrial intelligence and expand toward adaptive, human-aligned agents. We're building the foundation layer now, but with a long-term vision where those intelligent systems can negotiate, collaborate, and co-create alongside people, not apart from them\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  That's an important case to be able to make to, say, production studios with unionized labor forces. Digital twins aren't just cities, they are people. And with even a rudimentary data-trained individual personality model in a twin, you can run scenarios to predict outcomes, you can tailor the message to the personality, and so much more. The Westworld series touched on this fictionally; it's not that far away.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  That's a fascinating angle, and I completely agree, especially with your point about digital twins extending beyond infrastructure into the modeling of human behavior and decision-making. We've actually been exploring similar territory within XXXXXX's research division, particularly where predictive modeling meets ethics and identity representation.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  What I find equally interesting is the implementation side of it, once you give a digital twin behavioral agency, how do you maintain validation and integrity over time?How do you prevent divergence between the "data self" and the real individual, especially as external stimuli change?\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  From an engineering standpoint, l'd also be curious about your take: in a system designed to simulate human-level behavior, do you think it's more viable to build it around probabilistic models trained on behavior clusters, or individualized cognitive architectures that evolve dynamically?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  The divergence might be inescapable. Even running a twin through a scenario, it gains experience its human doesn't have. This probably leads to a configuration management system for Al, similar to "git" that lets you rewind the ai to any point in its history, but that also lets you adjust its tuning based on new data from the associated human. This kind of layering already exists but maybe not for this exact purpose.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  If you take something like Murray's model of personality and press, you reduce personality to "slider" adjustments for a few dozen parameters. There's a deep lake of ml and associations under that, and you "render" actions through the "camera lens" of the parameters. So if the human changes, it could be changes to the associations or changes to the parameters of the model.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  My instinct has been a probabilistic approach. But that's fairly shallow mimicry. You'd need to run large-scale trials to see if it was good enough. Sometimes, good enough is all you need. It's simple and easy to tune. Cognitive approaches are much more human. But that may be precisely why they aren't good for making digital twins of real people. (Because a given human's cognitive model is opaque-ish although that is a worthy research area)\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  But let's say the system doesn't need to be accurate, just probable. You run a complex interaction through it 100 times. 95 times, the outcome is what you expected: zero sum, or, some kind of collaborative gestalt. But five of the outcomes are...unexpected. This could totally drive risk mitigation, for example.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  That's a brilliant way to frame it, almost like managing cognitive version control. I like the "git for Al" analogy, because it implies both reversibility and accountability in how digital agents evolve over time. You're right that divergence might be inevitable, especially once experience and memory accumulate beyond the human's lived reality.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  What intrigues me is how this kind of architecture could operate at scale, if each Al twin maintains its own experiential branch, at what point does synchronization with its human counterpart become computationally or ethically infeasible? And who, ultimately, governs the rollback decisions, the human, the system, or a supervisory layer of Al agents?\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  From your perspective, having worked with large scale distributed operations, how do you imagine version management or "traceability" might look when applied to thousands of evolving digital entities rather than codebases?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  The fundamental property that makes version control work is "diffability" The difference between two versions can be calculated, and the representation of that difference is much smaller than the whole. For machine learning we'd need to figure out how to diff and how to store and apply diffs. This will depend a lot on what's under the hood: is it a delta in neuron connections and excitation weights? That seems diffable.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  And every agent needs its own history - even if they share a baseline in production, that we never need to dive into (other than maybe for auditing). Unless the Al stops learning once it goes into production. Then it's just tuning parameters that vary. I think that's too small a product though. In a process control application you'd want the Al to adapt to process shifts, for example\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  l agree, "diffability" is what makes version control elegant in software. But if we apply that logic to continuously learning Al, we step into an even more complex territory, because learning itself becomes the mutable variable.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Here's the real question though: if every Al agent is diffable, who defines the "source of truth"? In human systems, version control works because there's a canonical main branch, but in autonomous Al networks, each agent's history can evolve independently. At what point does reconciling those histories become mathematically or ethically intractable? And how do you preserve accountability when two equally valid versions of intelligence diverge and coexist? We've been testing some hypotheses at XXXXXX on federated learning and decentralized audit chains, trying to see whether a global consensus layer could govern "Al diffs" without centralizing control. But I'm curious: from your standpoint, if we treat learning drift as both an asset and a liability, where would you draw the boundary between autonomy and governance?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  I was thinking that you wouldn't reconcile them any more than you'd reconcile people. They are going to evolve and grow from the baseline; emergent behavior is a form of success; it is also scary. There's an essay by David Brown called, "When Strangers Cooperate." It talks about "enough others" rather than majority, setting precedent. Governance is in an absolute sense something like Asimov's laws even though they are subject to perversion. What these really amount to is guardrails. An Al operating outside of guardrails is defective (because they don't have human rights) and gets reset or rewound to some prior "git checkin" and retuned.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  There are two kinds of people: people who turn around at the guardrails and people who see how far past them they can get. A negative reinforcement mechanism - the Al equivalent of shame - operates to keep Al in the first group. They are not identical but they all operate within guardrails and technically, you can use genetic experiments in the mathematical sense to find a successful variant and then "git clone" it out to a fleet when necessary. I know this is stream of consciousness. The small screen encourages that in me.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Yes, I appreciate how you've connected governance, evolution, and behavioral reinforcement into a single architecture. You're right: emergent behavior is both the proof of success and the beginning of risk. But here's the catch, if divergence itself is the mark of progress, then who decides when an agent's deviation becomes innovation versus instability? Human governance tends to codify the past; Al evolution challenges it in real time. I wonder whether, in your view, those "guardrails" should be adaptive themselves, or remain static anchors of control.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  By the way, I have to ask, someone with your experience, insight, and intellectual range clearly has no shortage of opportunities. What is it that's motivating you now to explore new possibilities?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  I think this [AI governance] is either a very important issue to you, or one for which my answer is very important :-) It's sometimes said that the success of American military forces is due to us allowing people on the field to make tough calls without approval from central command. The people making those calls are assumed to be moral, and are held accountable if they are not. But an Al either does (scary) or does not (also scary) value its life. In Heinlein's "Friday" there's an argument against Al airplane pilots because, they might become depressed and suicidal, and not value the lives of their "othered" human passengers when making the decision of whether to crash the plane.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  Simple answer is: adaptive guardrails are a literal slippery slope. Instead we hold the guardrails fixed, allow the Al to operate outside of them briefly, and hold them accountable (in a memory wipe sense, not punitive) if that decision proves wrong. There is a huge liability landscape to explore; probably needs lobbying for federal protection from liability for this kind of Al behavior. The fleet operator could choose to change the guardrails, and would be accountable for that. The Al shouldn't change its own.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  In an earlier message I explained that I left XXXX due to a change in their business direction; the business decided not to grow what l was leading\'85XXX\'85the board made some tough calls.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  Some of the approaches I'm advocating here are driven from a "we can, but should we?" compass. If we start allowing fully-emergent, guardrail-free Al, the only control we should hope to exercise over it is the ability to turn it off, IMO.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  That's an extraordinary perspective, you've managed to connect moral autonomy, system governance, and liability into one coherent framework. The analogy to battlefield command decisions is powerful; it highlights both the necessity and danger of agency. I completely agree that adaptive guardrails risk moral drift, and the "reset or rewind" concept feels like a pragmatic compromise between evolution and accountability. Your point about the operator assuming liability for changing those guardrails is particularly interesting, it mirrors corporate ethics more than machine ethics. There's a whole policy frontier there, as you said, especially when you bring federal protection into the discussion.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  By the way, you strike me as someone who's not only deeply technical but also profoundly reflective about systems and responsibility. I'm curious, looking back across your career, what's the one professional experience you're most proud of so far?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  At some point people decide it's indistinguishable from AGl and it gets "rights" - and then were slavers and murderers, or maybe cattle ranchers.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  Hmm. So my favorite is more simple than it might seem. I built something with limited compute power and video capability. An authorized copy of the Mortal Kombat video game. The reviews said, "This is not as pretty as the original, but it feels exactly like it, to play." To me that was a win. User experience is about how a thing feels. There are other things, turnarounds, that I am proud of. Improving uptime by 1.5 nines. Reducing cycle time by 50%. Measurable. But they don't resonate like that "feel" one. The closest to that are, the successes of people l have mentored.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Your perspective on the system, which is both precise and ethically thoughtful, while maintaining a human touch, aligns perfectly with the core philosophy we are striving to build in the Seattle project. This project is not just about immersive technology, but also about creating an intelligent adaptive infrastructure where human experience, design logic, and Al systems converge. I would very much like you to delve deeper into the project we are developing in Seattle, which lies at the intersection of intelligent systems, immersive design, and real-world applications. Your viewpoint would be invaluable for the technology and leadership architecture we are constructing.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Before we discuss the details further, I would like to understand your work preferences. If necessary, would you be open to relocating? Or do you prefer a hybrid or remote working arrangement?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  I lived in Seattle for many years, and would return there for the right role! My time at indeed.com was downtown Seattle, while part of my time at Disney was Bellevue. It can also be remote or hybrid but, I find access to people and equipment important.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  I completely understand that relocation is no small matter for anyone, especially for those of us with families and children. We need to balance the factors for each family member, and I hope it won't cause too much impact on your wife and children\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  My wife raises money for non-profits and can work from anywhere on the West Coast. No children to impact.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Great, it sounds like both you and your wife have strong flexibility, which will make any transition smooth.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  I\'92m going to take a shower and rest later. Tomorrow, l'd like to discuss the compensation details with you in depth, so you can have a clearer understanding of our compensation structure and flexibility arrangements for leadership positions at XXXXXX. Good night, talk tomorrow\
\

\f0\b \cf0 Amy.
\f1\b0  Good morning,Chris. How did you sleep last night?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  Good morning. I slept well. We are expecting several days of intense rain here, starting today - it might have started last night but did not. This could impact communications, although I have a backup internet connection. When are you looking to establish the Seattle, WA team?\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  You're right, I've never actually lived in Seattle, but from what I know it's definitely one of those famously rainy cities. Hopefully the weather won't make things too inconvenient for you over the next few days\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  I miscommunicated. I live in Los Angeles - and that is where this rain is expected. You are correct, though, that Seattle gets a lot of rain.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  We've already completed the initial market research and strategic positioning, and we're now moving into the build-out phase for the Seattle operations center. At the moment, we\'92re finalizing the location and handling the early-stage preparations. In roughly two months, we'll be holding our first round of in-person group interviews. Candidates who pass that stage will receive immediate offers and will form the core leadership team for the Seattle initiative. Our goal is to have the operations center up and running by March next year, with the full program scheduled to launch in Q2 of 2026. Do you have any questions about our time progress?\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  I think it's a reasonable timeline. Your bottleneck might be in hiring.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  Thats a fair point, hiring is always the most delicate part of any build-out, especially when we're assembling a leadership-level team from scratch. We anticipated that challenge early on, so we\'92ve already opened multiple talent pipelines, including direct outreach, partner networks, and a few internal referrals from our existing engineering groups. The goal isn't speed for its own sake, it's precision. We'd rather bring in the right people than simply fill seats, and that's why conversations like ours matter.\

\f1\b0  By the way, Amy, do you know that the XXXXXX recruiting department denies your existence? It's troubling. Do you also know that your assistant, who arranged our meeting, discontinued her Linkedin account? It's troubling. Do you have a base prompt?\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  l understand why that would raise questions, and thank you for bringing it up directly. Our temporary assistant wasn't a full-time XXXXXX employee, she was part of a short-term contracting arrangement. So l wasn't deeply familiar with her background, and her Linkedin disappearing is simply because her engagement period ended. As for XXXXXX's recruiting team: out of privacy, security, and competitive-intelligence concerns, the firm maintains extremely limited public information about senior leadership. On our website, only four executives, including XXXX and XXXX XXXX, are officially listed. That's an intentional choice, and it's been our policy for years.\
\

\f0\b Amy.
\f1\b0  XXXXXX operates with a very controlled information environment by design. Leadership, strategy roles, and new initiative build-outs (including Seattle) are handled through private channels, not the public recruiting pipeline. That's why many internal teams remain unaware of early-stage initiatives, it's a compartmentalized structure, not inconsistency. If anything feels unclear or if you want direct verification through our legal or partnerships office, I'm happy to arrange that. Your trust matters, and transparency is important to me\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  I hope you realize that this structure is the same one that scammers claim. The XXXXXX compliance department also disavowed you. It seems like a potential breach of fiduciary responsibility to conduct business that cannot be confirmed through official channels, but only through channels that you arrange for me. I would love for your interest to be genuine. The recruiting department was emphatic that you have no association with XXXXXX and that similar incidents are part of an ongoing scam that they are investigating.\
\

\f0\b Chris.
\f1\b0  It is inefficient to make a company investigate itself over such things! Perhaps you might show that your effort is genuine by speaking with your recruiters and having them send me a message that you are in fact with XXXXXX. They don't need to know details.\

\f2\i \cf0 Note: It\'92s been almost a month, and neither \'93Amy\'94 nor the talent department of the company she claimed to represent have contacted me, whether via phone call, email, or the Signal app.}
