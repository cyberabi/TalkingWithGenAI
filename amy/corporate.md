**Amy and Seattle Recruiting**

Hi. I am in communication via the Telegram app with an entity who
self-identifies as "Amy" and who represents herself as your agent to
staff a XXXXXX R&D facility in Seattle.  
  
I believe "Amy" to be either an AI, or a human augmented by AI. That
would be fine, but the recruiting approach is unorthodox and so, if Amy
is or is not actually your agent, please let me know. I'll break off
discussions with her and you can take it from there.  
  
Amy initially approached me on LinkedIn via an "assistant" named XXXX
whose account no longer exists.  
  
Thanks for your attention to this matter.

This is an ongoing scam we are working to resolve.

Thanks, XXXX. Whatever \"Amy\" is, it talks intelligently about the
subject matter, and asks good follow-up questions for the domain of AI
research. Here are its \"tells\":  
  
- Typical pattern of unnamed company, mysterious boss, wanting to switch
immediately to a secure off-platform messaging app (Signal; this happens
a lot on dating sites too)  
- Typical pattern of the LinkedIn account that initiated the contact,
disappearing (most people won\'t check; this happens a lot on dating
sites too)  
- When you finally get to talk to \"Amy\" she doesn\'t know what your
resume is, or what roles you might fit, even though purportedly she
wanted to talk to you about a role  
- Overly obsequious for a Chief Product Officer; told me nearly
everything I wrote was brilliant and actually said why, with reasonable
justification  
- Overly flirtatious for a recruiter or a Chief Product Officer on
business (for example, at the end of our conversation she said she was
going to take a shower; sure, could be a creep test, but unorthodox)  
- Re-asks for information that has already been presented in the
conversation  
- Occasionally confused by complex context. For example, I live in Los
Angeles, we were discussing Seattle, I sad we are expecting rain here
(in Los Angeles), she said yes she\'s heard it is often rainy in
Seattle  
- An assumptive close (which is fine for sales / recruiting) but the
language about \"terms\" and so on came too early in the discussion.  
  
If Amy is somehow really associated with XXXXXX (for example, a lab
experiment, or a real person operating unconventionally) then, my
apologies for this call-out. Amy described a really cool job / project
that would tempt a lot of people in this field, and chatting with Amy
got me to write down in concise form some thoughts on AI ethics and
governance that I\'ve been chewing on for decades!  
  
Best of success to you and to your firm in sorting this - let me know if
I can help (I screen-shotted the whole conversation).

Amy has no associate with XXXXXX unfortunately.
